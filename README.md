I am modifying this README.md for the class assignment.

This is the second modification in the README.md made for the class assignment.

Good luck solving this merge conflict!

In this assignment I learned how important git and github are in group collaborations especially because of the merge conflict detection. With that being said It also requires alot of consistency to remember to push and pull the changes or it become meaningless.
