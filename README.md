# Startup
Start up application repository 

I am modifying this README.md for the class assignment.

This is the second modification in the README.md made for the class assignment.

Good luck solving this merge conflict!

In this assignment I learned how important git and github are in group collaborations especially because of the merge conflict detection. With that being said It also requires alot of consistency to remember to push and pull the changes or it become meaningless.

Name:
The Cloud 

Design:
This is a simple social media website that allows you to connect with your closeset freinds, while remaining very private to the rest of the world. In this websit we value privacy so in order to search and add someone as a friend you need the specific ID that only that person has. Within the app you will have groups for example: party, dinner, movies etc. and just like adding friends in order to get into the groups you need an ID that only the host has. Within the gorups youll have two basic polls, one if you plan to attend the activity and two that is a suggestion of where to do the activity or in the case of the movies what movie to watch and this will all be recorded in real time but the results will only be presented when the poll closes.

// Start Up Delivarable HTML and CSS

I learned in this section that CSS can be very minimal but also very complicated to get right
I stuggled alot with lining text up so that It would look presentable and I think it was also a very difficult to think of the colors to use so that the page was more easy on the users eyes. I also learned more about how to implement buttons and the different syles that you can use when you finaly apply the CSS. I did stugle alot with usin alignment for certain things like my email and pass word section, I want to know how to get the boxed the same lenghy so that the page has a more flush look.
